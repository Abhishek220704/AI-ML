🤖 1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?

ML = Making machines learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML:

Supervised Learning → Learn from labeled data.

Regression (predict numbers: house price, stock price).

Classification (predict categories: spam/not spam).

Unsupervised Learning → No labels, just structure.

Clustering (grouping: customer segmentation).

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE).

Reinforcement Learning → Agent learns by trial & error (self-driving car, game AI).

📈 2️⃣ Key Algorithms
(a) Regression

Linear Regression – predicts continuous values.

Equation:

y = w1x1 + w2x2 + ..... + b

📌 Example: Predict salary from years of experience.

(b) Classification

Logistic Regression – predicts probabilities (yes/no).

Uses sigmoid function to squash output between 0–1.

📌 Example: Spam vs. Not Spam.

(c) Decision Trees & Random Forest

Tree splits data based on features.

Random Forest = multiple trees + majority vote (reduces overfitting).


(d) Clustering

K-Means Clustering – groups data into K clusters.
Steps:

Choose K cluster centers.

Assign points to nearest center.

Recompute centers.

Repeat.

📌 Example: Grouping customers by spending habits.

3️⃣ Training & Evaluation
Common Metrics:

Regression → MSE, RMSE, MAE, R².

Classification → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

👉 Important Example:
Dataset = 95% negative class, 5% positive.
If model predicts all “negative” → Accuracy = 95%, but useless!
👉 Use Precision, Recall, F1.

Overfitting vs Underfitting

Overfitting → Model learns noise (great on train, bad on test).

Underfitting → Model too simple (bad on both).

✅ Solutions:

Overfitting → Regularization (L1/L2), Dropoutl.

4️⃣ Mini Example (Python), Pruning trees.

Underfitting → Add features, complex mode
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Fake data: Years of experience vs Salary
X = [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
y = [30000, 35000, 40000, 45000, 50000]

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, pred))
